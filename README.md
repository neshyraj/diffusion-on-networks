# diffusion-on-networks
project at University of Oxford simulating contagion and network diffusion

Looks at the community structure of social networks in Indian villages
Uses homophily via assortativity to try to establish some pattern of program adoption (contagion)
Simulates a model of diffusion on the network

Project done as part of the class C5.10 Mathematics and Data Science for Development
